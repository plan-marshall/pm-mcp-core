# Epic: pm-mcp-core work packages, roadmap Milestones 2 to 4

## Vision

Implement every work package of `doc/plans/` in this repository — the 35 packages that serve
roadmap Milestones 2 to 4 — one plan per package, each landing as one pull request here with its
documentation pull request in `plan-marshall-documentation`. The work is too large for one plan
because the packages form a dependency graph about nine packages deep that spans `pm-core`,
`pm-workflow` and `pm-runtime`. The index `doc/plans/README.adoc` stays the only place that states
a package's status and dependencies; this epic sequences against it and never replaces it. The
epic is done when every package in that index is `done`, or is recorded here as blocked on a
decision or a dependency outside this repository.

## Queue annotations

- PLAN-05 — not a package of `doc/plans/`: staged from the operator's HTTP rules, because the
  existing provider tests use hand-made `FakeServer` classes and `CiHttpClient` imports
  `java.net.http`. It adds its own package file and index row.
- PLAN-19 — parked: waits on `pm-mcp-clients` / `profile-documents` (`open` there on 2026-10-09).
  It gates PLAN-25 `waits` and PLAN-26 `role-sets-and-model-caller`, and through them most of
  WS-04 and WS-05 — the first external dependency on the critical path.
- PLAN-27 — staged, but also waits on `pm-mcp-clients` / `exec-read-denied-paths`.
- PLAN-36 — serves Milestone 6; ready now and disjoint by package from every other plan, so it
  is a good filler for a free slot. It sits at the queue end because a row's order is fixed when
  it is staged; ask for it by id when a slot is free.
- PLAN-37 — parked: `blocked` in the index on the operator's tool decision.

## Decisions

- 2026-10-09 — One orchestrator epic for the whole repository, not one per milestone or per
  module. Alternatives: an epic per milestone; an epic per module. Rationale: the dependencies
  cross every such cut (Milestone 2's `stalled-scope-detection` needs Milestone 3's
  `store-substrate` and `workflow-engine`; `workflow-engine` in `pm-workflow` needs
  `store-substrate` in `pm-core`), and an epic orders only its own queue.
- 2026-10-09 — `parallelization_scope` set to 3 by the operator on first init (project default
  suggestion was 1).
- 2026-10-09 — The operator switched `orchestrator.use_worktree` on right after init. The ledger
  lives in the shared ledger worktree and reaches `main` only through `land`; the ignore rule
  that makes it trackable and the knob itself are PR #16.

- 2026-10-09 — Decomposed into 8 workstreams and 37 staged plans: one plan per work package (36)
  plus PLAN-05 `http-baseline`. The operator's planning rules — Java 25 baseline, HTTP calls
  through `cui-http`, HTTP tests on `cui-test-mockwebserver-junit5` — stand in every spec as
  Standing Constraints.
- 2026-10-09 — Split guard: PLAN-08, PLAN-27 and PLAN-36 carry five bullets each and proceed
  unsplit; the work package is the unit the index defines, and the index leaves a split to the
  trace matrix of the executing plan.
- 2026-10-09 — Superseded the same day: the specs first declared `PmMcpLogMessages` as shared
  surface, which made the gate ask on 553 of 666 plan pairs.
- 2026-10-09 — Operator decision (AskUserQuestion): log identifiers stay in the three-digit
  scheme and are allocated per workstream, same offsets in each level — WS-01 x50-x59, WS-02
  x60-x69, WS-03 x70-x79, WS-04 x80-x89, WS-05 x90-x99, WS-07 x02-x09; WS-06 and WS-08 get none.
  Alternatives: widen to four digits with a block per plan (recommended, declined); no allocation.
  `PmMcpLogMessages` is therefore NOT a declared surface any more. This is a deliberate
  under-declaration: plans of one workstream still share a block, and the guard is
  `PmMcpLogMessagesTest`, which refuses an identifier used twice.

## Open Defects

## Watches

- PR #16 must be on `main`, and the ledger worktree on that base, before the first `land`:
  until then the worktree's `.gitignore` still ignores the ledger.
- `code-analysis-base` (added by #15, serves Milestone 6, depends on nothing, `open`) is in the
  index but outside the Milestone 2 to 4 scope this epic was framed for — decide at `decompose`
  whether it joins the queue.
- Nearly every package is expected to edit both `doc/plans/README.adoc` (its status row) and
  `PmMcpLogMessages` in `pm-core`; two shared files is the threshold at which the disjointness
  gate asks the operator — decide at `decompose` how the specs declare these two files.
- About eleven packages land in `pm-core` package `core.store` — re-check at each pairing decision.
- Cross-repository blockers: `profile-loader` waits on `pm-mcp-clients` / `profile-documents`;
  `job-confinement-and-environment` waits on `pm-mcp-clients` / `exec-read-denied-paths` —
  re-check when those merge and their `SNAPSHOT` is deployed.
- `differential-test-harness` is `blocked` on an operator tool decision (a Python interpreter in
  the test environment and a `plan-marshall` checkout at the pinned inventory commit).
