# Settled narrative: pm-mcp-core-m2-m4

Sections of `epic.md` whose subject is closed, moved here verbatim by `cleanup` on 2026-10-12 with the operator's confirmation. Each origin keeps a pointer.

## Watch: PR #16 before the first land

- PR #16 must be on `main`, and the ledger worktree on that base, before the first `land`:
  until then the worktree's `.gitignore` still ignores the ledger.

## Watch: code-analysis-base at decompose

- `code-analysis-base` (added by #15, serves Milestone 6, depends on nothing, `open`) is in the
  index but outside the Milestone 2 to 4 scope this epic was framed for — decide at `decompose`
  whether it joins the queue.

## Watch: the two files nearly every package edits

- Nearly every package is expected to edit both `doc/plans/README.adoc` (its status row) and
  `PmMcpLogMessages` in `pm-core`; two shared files is the threshold at which the disjointness
  gate asks the operator — decide at `decompose` how the specs declare these two files.
