## Objective

Implement the work package `supervisor` of `doc/plans/supervisor.adoc`: worker supervisor. Serves: Roadmap Milestone 4. Where: pm-runtime package `runtime.worker`. The package file is the brief; this spec adds what the orchestrator observed and the constraints of the epic.

## Deliverables

The bullets of `doc/plans/supervisor.adoc` § What, in its words (regenerated at 710da61, after the specification moved into this repository).

1. One supervisor per project and role: starting fresh and warm workers within the role's count and the model slots, acknowledgement, silence and exit detection, idle and token-budget recycling, ending and fencing, the start-failure guard.
2. Changed configuration: a warm worker is recycled after its task when the role's configuration digest over the effective values differs from its generation's (an edited artifact, a changed role assignment, or a plan override); the start-failure guard clears on such a change.
3. Pause at once: a worker whose plan the operator pauses at once is ended by force at once, its task queued again without counting a re-offer.
4. Idle: a `wait_again` answer to a generation holding a lease (consulting, or holding for an answer) is no idle wake-up.
5. The missing answer acknowledgement as a loss of a continuing worker, and the token budget reached during a hold (the hold ends, the task suspends or falls back, the worker is recycled), are `question-continuation`'s; the off-track signals and their actions on live workers are `worker-activity`'s. Reports of the supervisor go to both clients and the audit log.

**Done when** (the package's own acceptance): With a fixture harness and a virtual clock: each loss is detected at its deadline and never before; a start failure repeated to the guard's count ends the role's starts, and a changed role configuration clears the guard; a pause at once ends the plan's worker by force and re-queues its task without counting a re-offer; a changed role assignment recycles a warm worker after its task; a consulting worker's `wait_again` answers do not recycle it as idle.

**Trace starting set** (the requirements, use cases and roadmap live in `../plan-marshall-documentation`; the specifications and watch documents of the engine in this repository, `doc/specification/` and `doc/implementation-watch/`):

- Requirements: PM-WORK-3, PM-ARCH-8
- Specification: Model Work § Supervision & Recycling; Client Profiles § Worker Block
- Watch: Model Work; Client Profiles

## Standing Constraints

Set by the operator for every plan of this epic on 2026-10-09, beside the rules of `CLAUDE.md`:

- **Java 25 is the baseline.** Write for Java 25 and use its language and library features where they fit; no fallback for an older release. The release comes from the parent POM and is not overridden here.
- **HTTP calls go through `cui-http`.** No direct `java.net.http` or other HTTP client. The build forbids `cui-http` in `pm-core` and `pm-workflow`, so an HTTP call belongs in `pm-runtime` or a provider module, behind an interface the foundation declares.
- **HTTP tests use `cui-test-mockwebserver-junit5`.** Every test that involves HTTP runs against it; no hand-made fake server. The operator's statement is the consent `CLAUDE.md` requires for adding it as a test-scope dependency.
- **Work the package as the index says** (`doc/plans/README.adoc` § How to Work a Package, as reworded by #19): the usual plan-marshall flow — a branch, the commits of the plan, a pull request opened at finalize. No draft pull request claims the package; before starting, list the open pull requests for one that names it. The pull request removes the package's row from the index and deletes its package file within its commits, and drops the package from the _Depends on_ column of every row that names it. Build the trace matrix of `traced-implementation` before code, deliver the remainder the roadmap item leaves, and finish with `verify`, `verify -Ppre-commit`, `verify -Pcoverage` and `verify -Pintegration-tests` green.
- **Documents (operator decision 2026-10-15, pm-mcp-core ADR 007).** The specifications, the implementation watch and the traceability of the engine live in this repository: `doc/specification/`, `doc/implementation-watch/`, `doc/Traceability.adoc`, and the log message reference `doc/LogMessages.adoc`. This plan's one pull request carries the code, the tests, Javadoc and `package-info.java`, the developer documentation and ADRs, the deletion of the implemented specification sections and watch items, a correction of a specification statement it proves wrong, and the `Implementation:`, `Verified by:` and `Documentation:` lines of the requirements it implements in `doc/Traceability.adoc`. It opens a pull request in `plan-marshall-documentation` only to correct a requirement or to change `cross-cutting.adoc` or a specification that lives there; merging that one is the operator's. The concept and user documentation of the slice and the roadmap check-off are written there at the milestone exit: list them in the pull request body as **Owed to the milestone exit**.
- **Module documentation (operator decision 2026-10-11).** Documentation of the code lives in its module, in this plan's pull request, not in `plan-marshall-documentation`: the developer documentation of each package this plan changes in `pm-runtime/doc/developer/runtime-worker.adoc` (create or extend it: what the package is for, its main types and how they work together, how to use and extend it, invariants and failure modes, links to the specification sections it implements), and one ADR per design decision taken — every operator decision and every choice between alternatives — in `pm-runtime/doc/adr/runtime-worker/` as `NNN-{slug}.adoc`, the next free number of that directory, with the sections of `doc/adr/template.adoc` (Status, Date, Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences, Source) or, before that template exists, those same sections. A decision binding the whole repository goes to `doc/adr/`. The module's `README.adoc` gets one line only when this plan adds a new package; it is otherwise left alone. Layout: workstream WS-10.
- **Settled design: a refused project path is a value.** The confinement check that landed with #19 lives in `pm-core` package `core.store` (`PathConfinement`, `WorkspaceRoots`, `ConfinementOutcome`) and `pm-runtime` package `runtime.workspace` (`WorkspaceConfinement`). A refusal is returned as `ConfinementOutcome` carrying `path_traversal_rejected`; no checked exception type exists or is added. No consumer is wired to it yet (`pm-provider-git` included): a package that performs a file or repository operation for a project adopts the check itself.
- **Do not leave a design choice open that changes the file set.** Where two readings of a deliverable differ in the files they create, ask the operator at refine instead of deferring the choice to implementation.
- **Files shared by every plan.** In `doc/plans/README.adoc` remove only this package's own row (and its name from the _Depends on_ column); in `doc/Traceability.adoc` add only the sections of the requirements this package implements. Neither is a declared surface.
- **Specifications can be test input (found by PLAN-69, 2026-10-18).** A schema-parity test reads blocks of the `.adoc` specifications under `doc/specification/` (for example `WorkflowStatusSchemaParityTest` reads the JSON schema block after `== Workflow State Store` of `store-schemas/02-workflow-state-store.adoc`). Before the outline deletes or edits the implemented sections of a specification part, search the test tree for readers of that file, list each as a read file of the deliverable and state which blocks must stay byte-stable; a block a test reads is not deleted with the covered prose.
- **Checklist for durable multi-step protocols in `pm-runtime` and `core.store` (found by PLAN-74, 2026-10-18; four review rounds each found another unguarded transition of the credential-store move).** (1) A resume decides from the pair (record phase, state actually recorded), never from the phase alone, and a guard added to one phase branch gets its symmetric guard on every other branch; enumerate (phase x recorded state x writer) with a test per cell before the first review. (2) While a durable in-progress record exists, every other writer of the state it switches is refused under the same lock, and an authorization is verified against durable state, never asserted by the caller. (3) The record that drives recovery is deleted last, after every side effect (audit event, clean-up after a failure) is durable. (4) A decision with side effects (which store, which key) is decided once and persisted, never re-derived per call from a probe that can flap. (5) A copy-then-switch move has a test with a pre-populated target (an overlapping key and a target-only key) and a failure injected after the copy; the pre-existing-target hazard is checked for every kind of object the protocol copies (entries, integrity key, sidecars) in the same task. (6) A store's temp-file namespace is disjoint from its legal entry-name namespace. (7) A fix of a state-machine transition lists the specification section, the ADR, the Javadoc and the test that state it among its affected files and updates them in the same commit; ADR and test are checked against the specification text, not against the code they document. (8) The invariants of a multi-write protocol are stated per crash window, not per phase. (9) A test that asserts a file location derives the expected path from the production layout independently, never from the object under test. (10) A native binding is loaded once; only what can change at runtime (a lock state) is probed per operation.
- **Facts about `pm-runtime` (found by PLAN-20, 2026-10-18).** (1) FFM downcall descriptors (`MacSecurity`, `Posix`, the `kill(2)` descriptor of `KillBinding` and `ProcessGroupSignals`) are registered in `pm-runtime/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/de.planmarshall/pm-runtime-credentials/reachability-metadata.json`, not in the `plan-marshall-mcp` assembly; verify a location claim with a path query, not with a Javadoc sentence. (2) `ProjectRecovery` is public and wired by the `pm-mcp-server` assembly in `plan-marshall-mcp`: a change of its factory methods needs a source-compatible overload or a named follow-up in `plan-marshall-mcp` after the SNAPSHOT deploy; the outline says which. (3) Signal numbers differ between Linux and macOS: a table of signal names for a job killed by a signal is chosen per OS, never taken from the Linux table. (4) In `pm-runtime`, suppress a Sonar rule inline at the declaration with a stated reason beside it where the design requires the flagged shape (seen: S2142, S3077, S6539, S1075), rather than reshaping the design or excluding the rule for the file.
- **Renumber the ADRs against `origin/main` before finalize and after every rebase (found by PLAN-14, 2026-10-18).** An ADR added to a module ADR directory (for example `pm-core/doc/adr/core-store/`) can take a number another plan took in the same directory; different slugs mean different file names, so git reports no conflict and the duplicate-number gate of the branch-cleanup step scans only `doc/adr`. List the touched ADR directories with `git ls-tree origin/main` and renumber the plan's ADRs to the next free numbers; PLAN-14 renumbered twice.
- **Log messages: the holder of your module, next free identifier** (operator decision 2026-10-13; pm-mcp-core #64, ADR `doc/adr/005-one-log-message-holder-per-module.adoc`). A new INFO, WARN or ERROR record goes into the holder of the module whose production code logs it, at the next free identifier of its level (INFO 1-99, WARN 100-199, ERROR 200-299, the same ranges in every holder); for this plan: `RuntimeLogMessages` (`de.planmarshall.runtime.log`, prefix `PM_RUNTIME`). A record two modules log goes to the lower one (`pm-core`); a module logs only through its own holder and `CoreLogMessages`. There are no workstream blocks and nothing is renumbered. A provider's first record creates its holder `de.planmarshall.provider.<x>.log.<X>LogMessages` (prefix `PM_PROVIDER_<X>`) with a `package-info.java`, and adds the prefix to `KNOWN_PREFIXES` in `CoreLogMessagesTest`. After a rebase, run the holder's test, which refuses an identifier used twice or outside its level's range, and move to the next free one. The same identifiers go into `doc/LogMessages.adoc` of this repository, under the holder's section.

- **Format versions stay 1 (operator decision 2026-10-13).** Nothing is released yet, so every versioned artifact (`format_version` of a store document, record, sidecar, journal, codec) stays at version 1. A format change replaces version 1 in place: no version bump, no reader for an older version, no migration. Do not raise a `FORMAT_VERSION` constant, a `format_version` in a fixture, schema or specification example, or an ADR that records a bump.

- Verify-first clause: before scoping, read the roadmap item this package serves for what the code already covers, list the open pull requests for one that names `supervisor`, and check in `doc/plans/README.adoc` that every dependency is `done`; a refutation of any claim above loops back to re-scope.

## Expected Surface

- OBSERVED: `pm-runtime/src/main/java/de/planmarshall/runtime/worker/` — production code
- HYPOTHESIS: `pm-runtime/src/test/java/de/planmarshall/runtime/worker/` — tests; new directory

- HYPOTHESIS: `pm-runtime/doc/developer/runtime-worker.adoc` — developer documentation of the package; created or extended
- HYPOTHESIS: `pm-runtime/doc/adr/runtime-worker/` — ADRs of the package's design decisions; new directory if absent
- OBSERVED: `doc/plans/supervisor.adoc` — the package file, deleted when the package is done
- OBSERVED: `doc/implementation-watch/client-profiles.adoc` — watch document; the covered items deleted
- OBSERVED: `doc/implementation-watch/model-work.adoc` — watch document; the covered items deleted

- OBSERVED: `doc/specification/model-work/03-supervision-and-recycling.adoc` — specification part; the implemented sections deleted

## Dependencies and Sequencing

- Depends on: PLAN-29 (`worker-launch`); PLAN-28 (`task-queue-and-protocol`)
- Overlaps with: no other plan by package; every plan through `doc/plans/README.adoc`; the plans of the same module through its log holder, which is not a declared surface
- Adjacent to: the Quarkus assembly `pm-mcp-server` in `plan-marshall-mcp` and the client contract `pm-api` in `pm-mcp-clients`, which stay untouched — a change there is a pull request in that repository; and `plan-marshall-documentation`, where only a requirement correction or a change of `cross-cutting.adoc` or of a specification that lives there goes, in a pull request there

## Hand-Off Command

```text
/plan-marshall task="implement .plan/orchestrator/pm-mcp-core-m2-m4/plans/PLAN-30-supervisor.md"
```

## Write-Boundary

The plan implementing this spec touches only its own repository source and tests. It creates
and edits NO file under `.plan/orchestrator/` other than its own
`inbox/{sender}-{seq}` message — the orchestrator owns every other ledger write — and reports
its outcome through its PR and its inbox message. The inbox exception's qualifiers and the
sole sanctioned write mechanism are stated in
`persona-plan-orchestrator/standards/orchestration-model.md` § Ledger Write-Boundary.
